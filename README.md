## Introduction:
I am performing Sentiment Analysis and Classification using song lyrics and livestream subtitles of the pop group BTS.
BTS is often acclaimed for their positive messages and personal depth of lyrics.

While VADER sentiment analysis tool is known to perform very well with social media texts, I want to check how well it can decipher the meanings and subtleties of poetry and lyrics.

In addition, I use classification tools to check if song lyrics can be told apart from daily conversations. For this, I add the transcripts (subtitles) of livestreams of BTS from popular Korean live-streaming app V Live to the dataset.

Please see the MAIN notebook for more information

An outline of the code process is described in the flowchart below.
